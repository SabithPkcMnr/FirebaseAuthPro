An ultimate Android App for all kind of Firebase Authentication with the goal of helping beginner Android Developers. I have also added some useful comments for some codes and conditions for the auth to work properly. In this app I will be using all the possible type of Firebase Auths start from Email & Password, OTP, Google Sign-in & more that are offered by Firebase so keep an eye on the repo as I thrive to update the app very often as I become free. This app make it easy for the beginners to integrate Firebase Auth into their app and I can too use the same code for my future projects.
